# What does the new EV consumer look like?
The average EV owner has remained the same over the past 10 years, 40-55 year old males with an annual household income of more than $100,000. However, new trends and demographics have emerged. This project answers two key objectives: 
* What is the existent opportunity of revenue growth for EV manufacturers in Europe?
* What does the new EV consumer look like? How can managers at EV companies understand different customer segments in terms of demographics, driving behavior, and charging behavior?
